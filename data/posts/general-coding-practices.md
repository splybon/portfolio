Coffee Thoughts are a series of slack posts used to generate discussion at my place of work.

Hey there coffee heads.I wanted to link out to an old favorite from [Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) today talking about 12 general coding best practices.  The article was written in 2000.  That's even before the agile manifesto came out.  If you need a reference point, [here](https://splybon.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/IMG_0460.jpg) is a picture of me in a pumpkin patch from that year.It's interesting looking back seeing how a lot of things ring true still, and then some things we take for granted now like version control.  There's just something cool about reading some of the difficulties from working on Microsoft Word and knowing that those problems are still prevalent today.A couple of takeaways for me

- For #3 in some ways it's easier to make daily builds as better CI platforms have become available to us.  You can just give netlify your github repo and bam you've got a website. And then in some ways I think it can be much harder since we have these distributed systems, and use so many technologies now in our build process that pipelines can become convoluted.
- For #11, this may be a hot take, but I would like to see more code being written in our interview process.  I know it's not an easy problem to solve, but I agree with his point that if you're hiring someone to write code you should observe them doing just that.  Glyn and I actually did a couple of react native interviews utilizing code sandbox and it worked well for us.  Happy to chat with anyone about that process.

Do any of these principles speak to you today? Or is there anything that Skookum could learn from this?
